- DDL to create two tables 

b) xlxs2csv.py 
- reads each of the pages from BI analytics assessment 2020.xlsx, 
- writes each page data to separate csv file,
- reads csv files and imports data to datawarehouse tables, test schema

c) queries.sql
- queries to get results/numbers used for the summary.

d) 201116 - MB Contorion BI Challenge.pdf
